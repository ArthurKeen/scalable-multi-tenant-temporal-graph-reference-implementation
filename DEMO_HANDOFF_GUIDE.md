## Prerequisites

### Required Before Demo

1. **ArangoDB Cluster Access**
   - URL: `https://9c12006b5b1e.arangodb.cloud:8529`
   - Database: `disjoint-smartgraph-temporal-database`
   - Credentials are in `setup_env.sh` (already configured)

2. **Python 3.8+**
   - Check: `python3 --version`
   - Should show: Python 3.8 or higher

3. **Project Directory**
   - Location: `/Users/arthurkeen/code/network-asset-management-demo`
   - All code and tests are ready to go

4. **Web Browser**
   - For ArangoDB Web Interface visualization
   - Login at: https://9c12006b5b1e.arangodb.cloud:8529

### System Status Verification

Before your demo, verify everything is working:

```bash
cd /Users/arthurkeen/code/network-asset-management-demo
source setup_env.sh

# Run quick tests (should see 100% passing)
PYTHONPATH=. python3 src/validation/test_suite.py
```

**Expected Output**: "All tests passed! Code quality verified."

---

## Pre-Demo Setup

### Step 1: Navigate to Project

```bash
cd /Users/arthurkeen/code/network-asset-management-demo
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

```bash
source setup_env.sh
```

**What this does**: 
- Exports `ARANGO_ENDPOINT` (database URL)
- Exports `ARANGO_USERNAME` (root)
- Exports `ARANGO_PASSWORD` (already configured)
- Exports `ARANGO_DATABASE` (database name)

**Verification**:
```bash
echo $ARANGO_ENDPOINT
# Should show: https://9c12006b5b1e.arangodb.cloud:8529
```

### Step 3: Open ArangoDB Web Interface (Optional but Recommended)

1. Open browser to: https://9c12006b5b1e.arangodb.cloud:8529
2. Login with credentials from `setup_env.sh`
3. Select database: `disjoint-smartgraph-temporal-database`
4. Keep this open in a separate tab for visualization during demo

## Running the Interactive Demo

### Option 1: Interactive Mode (Recommended for Live Demos)

**Best for**: Live presentations where you want to pause and explain each step

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 demos/automated_demo_walkthrough.py --interactive
```

**How it works**:
- Demo runs step-by-step
- Pauses at each section
- Press `Enter` to continue to next section
- You control the pace
- Perfect for Q&A during presentation

**Duration**: 15-30 minutes (depending on Q&A)

### Option 2: Auto-Advance Mode (For Quick Demo)

**Best for**: Automated walkthrough or time-constrained demos

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 demos/automated_demo_walkthrough.py --auto-advance --pause-duration 5
```

**How it works**:
- Automatically advances every 5 seconds
- No manual intervention needed
- Good for unattended displays
- Adjust `--pause-duration` as needed

**Duration**: ~10 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Connection failed"

**Symptoms**: Can't connect to database

**Solution**:
```bash
# 1. Check environment variables are set
echo $ARANGO_ENDPOINT
echo $ARANGO_DATABASE

# 2. If empty, run:
source setup_env.sh

# 3. Verify connectivity
ping 9c12006b5b1e.arangodb.cloud
```

### Issue: "Module not found"

**Symptoms**: Import errors when running demo

**Solution**:
```bash
# Always use PYTHONPATH=. prefix
PYTHONPATH=. python3 demos/automated_demo_walkthrough.py --interactive
```

### Issue: "Demo is slow"

**Symptoms**: Data generation taking long time

**Explanation**: This is normal! Generating 21,000+ documents takes 2-3 minutes. The demo is working correctly.

### Issue: "Tests failing"

**Symptoms**: Validation shows failures

**Solution**:
```bash
# Run test verification
PYTHONPATH=. python3 src/validation/test_suite.py

# Should show 21/21 passing
# If not, check database connectivity
```

### Issue: "Can't see data in browser"

**Symptoms**: Collections appear empty in ArangoDB UI

**Solution**:
1. Verify you selected the correct database: `disjoint-smartgraph-temporal-database`
2. Check collection name matches: `Device`, `Software`, etc. (case-sensitive)
3. Refresh the page (F5)

---

## Post-Demo Cleanup

### Option 1: Keep Data for Next Demo

Do nothing! The data persists and you can run the demo again anytime.

### Option 2: Full Reset (For Fresh Demo)

```bash
# This will delete all data and regenerate from scratch
PYTHONPATH=. python3 demos/automated_demo_walkthrough.py --interactive
# Select "Yes" when asked about database reset
```

### Option 3: Database Only Reset

```bash
# Reset database without regenerating local data files
PYTHONPATH=. python3 tools/reset_database.py
```

---

## Advanced Options

### Verbose Mode (For Technical Audiences)

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 demos/automated_demo_walkthrough.py --interactive --verbose
```

**Shows**: Detailed SQL queries, technical logs, performance metrics

### Custom Pause Duration

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 demos/automated_demo_walkthrough.py --auto-advance --pause-duration 10
```

**Use**: For larger projection screens or slower reading audiences

### Run Individual Components

If you want to demo specific parts only:

**Data Generation Only**:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 src/data_generation/asset_generator.py
```

**Database Deployment Only**:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 src/database/database_deployment.py
```

**Validation Only**:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 src/validation/validation_suite.py
```

## Demo Script Suggestions

### Opening (30 seconds)

"Today I'm showing you a reference implementation for multi-tenant temporal graph databases using ArangoDB. This demonstrates complete tenant isolation, time travel capabilities, and horizontal scalability - all production-ready features."

### During Data Generation (1 minute)

"We're generating 8 tenant datasets with over 21,000 documents total. Each tenant has their own network of devices, software, locations, and relationships. Notice the different scale factors - showing the system handles varying workload sizes."

### During Deployment (1 minute)

"Now we're deploying to ArangoDB with SmartGraphs - that's automatic sharding by tenant ID. The system creates MDI-prefixed multi-dimensional indexes that optimize our temporal queries. In the browser here, you can see all the collections being created with proper isolation."

### During Time Travel Demo (2 minutes)

"This is where it gets interesting. We can query our system state at any point in time. Let me show you in the browser - [run query] - see how we're filtering by created and expired timestamps? The MDI indexes make this fast even with thousands of documents. This is critical for compliance and auditing."

### During Scale-Out (2 minutes)

"One of the key features is horizontal scalability. We can add new tenants dynamically - watch the document count grow - and there's zero impact on existing tenants. In production, you'd also add database servers and rebalance shards, which I'll show you how to do..."

### Closing (30 seconds)

"So we've shown complete tenant isolation, temporal queries, automatic TTL management, and scale-out capabilities. The system is production-ready with 100% test coverage. All the code is available in the GitHub repository, and I'm happy to answer questions."
